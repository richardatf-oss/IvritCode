IvritCode Specification (v0.0)

Overview
IvritCode is a symbolic machine language in which:

Hebrew letters (א–ת) act as operators (instructions),

Hebrew letters (א–ת) also name registers (storage locations),

Niqqud (vowel points) act as instruction modifiers, and

A special register A represents Aleph-Olam, a hidden global register.

This document defines IvritCode v0.0, including the machine state, register layout, and the base (unmodified) semantics of each letter-operator.

Niqqud modifiers are specified separately and layer cleanly on top of this base instruction set.

Machine State 2.1 State Space
The IvritCode machine state is a fixed-length vector:

𝑆 ∈ 𝑅 23 S∈R 23

where 𝑅 R is a ring (v0 reference implementation uses integers; future versions may use a finite field).

2.2 Registers

The 23 registers are named as follows:

Index Name Description 0–21 א–ת One register per Hebrew letter 22 A Aleph-Olam (hidden/global register)

The register named A is not a Hebrew letter; it is a distinguished global register used for aggregation, inspection, and seeding.

2.3 Working Quartet

In v0, several instructions operate specifically on the working quartet:

( א , ב , ג , ד ) (א,ב,ג,ד)

These correspond to registers:

א = primary input

ב = secondary input

ג = derived value

ד = derived value

All other registers remain unchanged unless explicitly stated.

Instructions 3.1 Instruction Structure
An instruction consists of:

A letter operator 𝐿 ∈ { א , … , ת } L∈{א,…,ת}

Optional niqqud modifiers (not covered in this section)

This section defines the default (unmodified) semantics of each letter operator.

Letter Semantics (Base Forms)
Let the current machine state be:

𝑆

A is not an operator in v0.

A is a persistent global register.

Many operators read from or write to A.

Future versions may define an explicit A instruction.

Niqqud Modifiers (Reserved)
Niqqud marks act as instruction modifiers (e.g. purity, immediates, scope).

This specification defines only the base letter semantics. Modifier semantics are defined in a separate section.

Determinism
IvritCode v0 instructions are deterministic:

Identical initial states and identical instruction sequences always produce identical final states.
